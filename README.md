# BACKENDCODE
THIS IS A BACKEND CODE OR A ED-TECH PLATEFORM NAMED AS STUDYNOTION

Description of the Back-end Architecture: StudyNotion uses a monolithic architecture, with the backend built using Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB as the primary database.

Features and Functionalities of the Back-end: The back end of StudyNotion provides a range of features and functionalities, including:

   1.User authentication and authorization: Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and password. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
   
   2.Course management: Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.

   3.Payment Integration: Students will purchase and enrol on courses by completing the checkout flow that is followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.

   4.Cloud-based media management: StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.

   5.Markdown formatting: Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, which allows for easier display and rendering on the front end.

Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools used: The back end of StudyNotion uses a range of frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure its functionality and performance, including:

   1.Node.js: Node.js is used as the primary framework for the back end.
   
   2.MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
   
  3.Express.js: Express.js is used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.
   
   4.JWT: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.

   5.Bcrypt: Bcrypt is used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data

  6.Mongoose: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript

Data Models and Database Schema:
The back end of StudyNotion uses a range of data models and database schemas to manage data, including:

1. Student schema: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each student.
2. Instructor schema: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each instructor.
3. Course schema: Includes fields such as course name, description, instructor details, and media content.


Overall, the back-end of StudyNotion is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for an ed-tech platform, with a focus on security, reliability, and ease of use. By using the right frameworks, libraries, and tools, we can ensure that the platform functions smoothly and provides an optimal user experience for all its users.

API Design

The StudyNotion platform's API is designed following the REST architectural style. The API is implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses JSON for data exchange and follows standard HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Sample list of API endpoints and their functionalities:

 1. /api/auth/signup (POST) - Create a new user (student or instructor) account.
 2. /api/auth/login (POST) â€“ Log in using existing credentials and generate a JWT token.
 3. /api/auth/verify-otp (POST) - Verify the OTP sent to the user's registered email.
 4. /api/auth/forgot-password (POST) - Send an email with a password reset link to the registered email.
 5. /api/courses (GET) - Get a list of all available courses.
 6. /api/courses/:id (GET) - Get details of a specific course by ID.
 7. /api/courses (POST) - Create a new course.
 8. /api/courses/:id (PUT) - Update an existing course by ID.
 9. /api/courses/:id (DELETE) - Delete a course by ID.
 10. /api/courses/:id/rate (POST) - Add a rating (out of 5) to a course. Sample API requests and responses:
 11. GET /api/courses: Get all courses

      Response: A list of all courses in the database
 13. GET /api/courses/ðŸ†” Get a single course by ID

      Response: The course with the specified ID
 15. POST /api/courses: Create a new course

      Request: The course details in the request body

      Response: The newly created course
 16. PUT /api/courses/ðŸ†” Update an existing course by ID

      Request: The updated course details in the request body

      Response: The updated course
 17. DELETE /api/courses/ðŸ†” Delete a course by ID

      Response: A success message indicating that the course has been deleted.
  



In conclusion, the REST API design for the StudyNotion ed-tech platform is a crucial part of the project. The API endpoints and their functionalities are designed to ensure seamless communication between the front-end and back-end of the application. By following RESTful principles, the API will be scalable, maintainable, and reliable. The sample API requests and responses provided above illustrate how each endpoint will function and what kind of data it will accept or return. With this API design, StudyNotion will be able to provide a smooth user experience while ensuring security and stability.
